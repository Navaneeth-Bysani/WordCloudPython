This is a python program used to create a word cloud.

Getting started:
1. Pull the repo
2. Install (if not installed previously):
    wordcloud (pip install wordcloud)
    matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
3. Create the file with the desired text in the same directory(main directory)
4. Go to the open function call in 'main.py' file and replace the text in the quotes with the name of your file.
   (Few text files are already there in the repo. You can use them as well)
5. Run 'main.py'

Note: Make sure that there are no quotes in your text file (or replace all the quotes (") with (\"))
